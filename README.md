Fast and simple webdriver installation

**This is still a work in progress and not usable, yet**

## Goals

* Provide a command line tool that manages webdriver installation and updating
* Provide a library API that can be used to install webdrivers in your Rust
  application or tests
* Support for `chromedriver`, `geckodriver`, `edgedriver`, `iedriver`
